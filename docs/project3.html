<section id="why-this-question-matters" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-question-matters">📌 Why This Question Matters</h2>
<p>More and more startups are presenting themselves as <em>climate-neutral</em> or <em>climate-friendly</em>. But why are they doing that? What motivates them? The explanation is quite simple — and closely tied to investment opportunities. Investors are increasingly looking for sustainable ventures, and the climate tech ecosystem — including NGOs, researchers, entrepreneurs, and engaged individuals — plays a crucial role in addressing the climate crisis.</p>
<p>The first time I truly experienced the real face of climate change was while working in the humanitarian sector with affected communities. I saw first-hand how essential it is to anticipate and reduce climate risks — whether it’s earthquakes, floods, or heatwaves impacting already vulnerable populations. In these contexts, early action isn’t optional — it’s life-saving.</p>
<p>That’s where climate technologies, innovation and startups come in. <strong>At the forefront of developing game-changing technologies are tech ventures.</strong> They are often seen as engines of innovation, they move fast, experiment boldly, and frequently bring fresh ideas into spaces where traditional actors move slowly. They develop solutions ranging from climate risk prevention and renewable energy systems to energy efficiency innovations, carbon capture methods, and climate-resilient agriculture. Their work provides practical tools for mitigation, prediction, and adaptation.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I’ll try to give a brief overview of how we can assess whether young companies are genuinely climate-friendly or simply good at marketing themselves. In the following paragraphs, I’d like to address the following questions:</p>
<p>Are tech ventures truly driving a green transformation — or are we witnessing a new wave of eco-hype? What does it really mean for a startup to be climate-positive? And how can we tell the difference between genuine innovation and feel-good greenwashing?</p>
<hr>

<section id="what-makes-a-startup-truly-climate-positive" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-makes-a-startup-truly-climate-positive">📌 What Makes a Startup Truly Climate-Positive?</h2>
<p>First of all, I’d like to highlight that the terms <em>climate-neutral</em> and <em>climate-positive</em> are often used interchangeably—but they are not the same. <strong>Climate-neutral</strong> means balancing emissions to reach net zero — typically through a combination of reductions and offsets. <strong>Climate-positive</strong>, on the other hand, means going further: <strong>removing more carbon from the atmosphere than you emit</strong>. So:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>Climate-neutral ≠ climate-positive.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Nowadays, the term <em>climate-positive</em> is gaining a lot of traction, but it is not yet a globally standardized concept, and there is no single official framework that defines it.</strong> However, some of the most widely accepted standards in the European climate startup space provide valuable direction on what meaningful and credible climate action looks like.</p>
<p>After reviewing leading sources such as <strong>Project Drawdown</strong>, the <strong>EU Taxonomy,</strong> the <strong>United Nations Climate Technology Centre &amp; Network (CTCN)</strong>, and <strong>Climate Tech VC (CTVC)</strong>, I’ve identified a set of key aspects commonly used to assess whether a solution or startup can be considered climate-positive. Below is a brief overview of each:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Project Drawdown</strong> ranks <strong>science-based climate solutions</strong> across sectors. For them, the key focus is on <strong>demonstrated greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potential</strong>, not just theoretical impact. Solutions should ideally be <strong>scalable</strong> — regionally or globally — to maximize their effect.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>EU Taxonomy</strong> defines specific criteria for <strong>climate mitigation and adaptation</strong> activities and emphasizes the principle of <strong>“Do No Significant Harm”</strong> to other environmental objectives. It sets <strong>technical screening thresholds</strong>, helps <strong>prevent greenwashing</strong>, supports <strong>investment alignment</strong>, and drives <strong>regulatory standardization</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>According to the <strong>United Nations CTCN</strong>, a climate-positive solution should be <strong>applied in real-world settings</strong>, <strong>benefit climate-vulnerable communities</strong>, and contribute to <strong>long-term resilience and co-benefits</strong> — especially in the Global South.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Climate Tech VC (CTVC)</strong> brings the <strong>investor and startup perspective</strong>. It tracks climate-tech companies across sectors and highlights those delivering <strong>scalable, high-impact solutions</strong>. CTVC’s market maps are useful for identifying trends, technologies, and startups that contribute meaningfully to climate goals — beyond greenwashing or buzzwords.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these frameworks highlight the importance of <strong>transparency, trustworthy data, and a strong sense of accountability</strong>.<strong>They also reflect the differing priorities between key players in the climate space.</strong> While public sector actors often prioritize social and community-level impact, private sector stakeholders tend to focus on whether a technology is scalable, commercially viable, and market-ready.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-dark-side-greenwashing-tactics">📌 The Dark Side: Greenwashing Tactics</h2>
<p>Companies often like to use terms like <em>sustainable</em>, <em>eco-friendly</em>, and <em>climate-positive</em> — but are these claims <strong>real and credible</strong>, or just <strong>marketing buzzwords</strong>?</p>
<p>With growing pressure to appear green, it can be hard to tell the difference between real climate action and <strong>clever storytelling</strong>. So what are the <strong>red flags</strong> we should look out for? How can we recognize when a company or startup is engaging in <strong>greenwashing</strong> rather than delivering meaningful environmental impact?</p>
<p>If we want real climate solutions, we need to <strong>look beyond the buzzwords</strong>. There are some clear warning signs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The company <strong>lacks third-party certifications</strong> or reliable data to support its claims</p></li>
<li><p>There’s <strong>no reporting on emissions, supply chains, or climate targets</strong></p></li>
<li><p>A general <strong>lack of transparency</strong>, especially around environmental performance</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flashy green messaging</strong>, while the core business remains highly carbon-intensive</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As green branding becomes more profitable, <strong>regulators and watchdogs are paying closer attention</strong>. The <strong>European Commission</strong>, the <strong>OECD</strong>, and NGOs such as <strong>Carbon Market Watch</strong> are actively working to <strong>detect, monitor, and regulate</strong> misleading environmental claims. Their goal is to ensure that sustainability is based on <strong>verifiable evidence — not just marketing slogans</strong>.</p>

<section id="the-role-of-investors" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-role-of-investors">📌 The Role of Investors</h2>
<p>More and more startups and scaleups are positioning themselves as <em>green</em> or <em>climate-positive</em>. This opens doors to grants, green funds, and early-stage capital. Investors are often drawn to these buzzwords — and as a result, some startups <strong>exaggerate or misrepresent</strong> their environmental impact to attract funding. This phenomenon is widely known as <strong>greenwashing</strong>. Startups may overstate their carbon-saving potential without providing clear data or third-party verification, making it difficult to distinguish <strong>authentic impact</strong> from <strong>marketing-driven narratives</strong>.</p>
<p>Investors have a <strong>huge responsibility</strong> in this space. Forward-thinking investors are now shifting toward <strong>impact verification</strong>, using frameworks like the <strong>EU Taxonomy</strong>, the <strong>Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)</strong>, and <strong>independent ESG ratings</strong> to separate genuine climate solutions from eco-hype.</p>
<p>In the end, investor responsibility goes beyond capital. It includes asking the right questions, demanding data-backed accountability, and supporting startups that deliver <strong>real, measurable environmental benefits</strong>.</p>

<section id="final-thoughts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">📌 Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Startups play a crucial role in scaling climate solutions. As agile innovators, they act as catalysts within the broader climate ecosystem — testing, piloting, and scaling technologies that could help drive the transition to a more sustainable future.</p>
<p>But while their potential is clear, we must remain thoughtful and critical. <strong>Not all that is labeled “green” is truly sustainable.</strong> Green marketing can sometimes blur the line between genuine innovation and feel-good branding. That’s why <strong>climate tech must be held to high standards</strong> — especially as terms like <em>climate-positive</em> gain popularity without a globally agreed-upon definition.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I chose not to focus on detailed EU regulatory frameworks like the CSRD, even though they are highly relevant — particularly in connection with the EU Taxonomy. Instead, my aim was to give an accessible overview of the climate innovation landscape and offer a set of criteria for evaluating climate-positive claims with a more informed lens.</p>
<p>To help distinguish <strong>real impact from empty buzzwords</strong>, I’ve summarized key evaluation parameters below — drawn from trusted sources such as Project Drawdown, the EU Taxonomy, CTVC, and the UN Climate Technology Centre.</p>
<p>By applying these standards — whether you’re an innovator, investor, policymaker, or curious reader — you can help support climate solutions that are not just exciting, but also <strong>effective, credible, and truly sustainable.</strong></p>
