    "text": "🎯 The Vision Behind World Expo 2025\n\nI started writing this after reading about World Expo 2025, which will take place in Osaka, Japan. The theme is “Designing Future Society for Our Lives” — which, let’s be honest, is both incredibly ambitious and exactly what we should be aiming for.\nWorld Expos have always been a window into what’s possible. Since the very first one in 1851, they’ve introduced groundbreaking inventions like the telephone, the Eiffel Tower, and even ice cream cones. But beyond the gadgets, what’s more interesting to me is the way these events bring people together to reflect on what kind of world we want to live in.\nThis year’s Expo is structured around three main themes:\n\nSaving Lives\nEmpowering Lives\nConnecting Lives\n\nEach of them is packed with thought-provoking questions. But in this post, I want to zoom in on something specific:\nThe World Expo is an incredible opportunity to meet people from all over the globe. It brings together countries and cultures, celebrating innovation and without regard to age, gender, or status.Since the first World Expo in 1851, many impressive changes have taken place around the world.\nThis year’s theme is “Designing Future Society for Our Lives,” with three sub-themes: “Saving Lives,” “Empowering Lives,” and “Connecting Lives.” As this is just a short post, I won’t be able to cover all of the sub-topics in detail. That’s why I chose to focus on “The Future of Community and Mobility.”\n\nSmart cities\ndisaster prevention and reconstruction\nmetaverse\nspace\nrobots\nEV/FCV\nflying cars\ncyber security\n\n\nTechnology promises efficiency. Nature thrives on resilience. What if we stopped treating these as opposites?\nIn this essay, I explore what happens when we apply ecological thinking to artificial intelligence — and why it might be the mindset shift we need in the face of climate breakdown."

    "text": "As AI systems get smarter, more emotionally convincing, and more agentic—meaning they seem to act or decide things on their own—they raise a whole set of tricky ethical questions. One big one: Should AI pretend to care, when it doesn’t actually feel anything? When a chatbot says “I understand how you feel,” is that genuine support—or just emotional theater?\nAnd where’s the line between comfort and manipulation? Friendly AI builds trust—but could that trust be used to influence us without us even realizing it? In a world where chatbots adjust their tone, recommend actions, and even take initiative, this becomes a serious design dilemma.\nAnother hot topic is memory. Many new AI tools can recall past conversations with users. That means they can profile people over time. So what happens to our deepest, most personal questions once they’re stored and reused? Without proper safeguards, emotional data can turn into just another asset—used to train models, or worse, to shape how we’re targeted online.\nAt that point, chatbots aren’t just tools. They start to feel like digital extensions of ourselves. And that brings up more than just privacy issues. It’s about identity, profiling, and the risk of AI mimicking people so well that it’s hard to tell where the human ends and the machine begins.\nAs agentic AI becomes more common, our relationship with it changes. We start to assume it means well—even if it’s just running code. That’s why we need clear ethical boundaries, not just in how AI talks to us, but in how it’s designed from the ground up. The more lifelike and autonomous it becomes, the more responsibility we all carry—as users, as designers, and as a society."

    "text": "📌 Smart Cities: Buzzword or Real Solution?\nIf you’ve ever seen the phrase “smart city” on a tech blog or a conference banner, you probably imagine energy-efficient buildings, self-driving cars, and sensors that know when the trash bins are full.\nLet’s take a closer look at smart cities like Amsterdam, Vienna, or Copenhagen. In this post, I’m focusing on European examples, but of course, I could have just as easily mentioned Seoul, Singapore, or even Dubai.\nIn Amsterdam, buildings automatically adjust lighting and heating based on occupancy and time of day. Vienna promotes energy-efficient housing and integrated mobility in its smart district (Seestadt), where residents test eco-living technologies in real life. Barcelona uses sensors and GPS to manage bus schedules in real time, cutting down waiting times and reducing emissions.\nThese ideas aren’t just about flashy technology—they’re about making daily life smoother, supporting climate goals, and creating healthier, more livable cities.\nBut here’s something important to remember: if we design smart cities without including different voices and perspectives, we risk creating spaces that look perfect in digital renderings but feel cold or unwelcoming in real life. Technology alone isn’t enough.\nOn one hand, smart cities sound like an amazing solution—making everyday life easier, more efficient, and more connected. But on the other hand, we need to think beyond the tech. A truly smart city isn’t just tech-optimized; it’s also community-centered—a place where people feel they belong, where they can connect with others, and where they feel seen, heard, and included."

Or the metaverse: virtual spaces where people can work, learn, shop, and even attend major events. In 2022, for example, the first-ever Metaverse Fashion Week was hosted on the Decentraland platform — featuring global brands, digital runways, and virtual afterparties. It showed that even culture and community gatherings are starting to move into these immersive digital worlds.\nAnd self-driving cars? They’re no longer just prototypes. In cities like Shenzhen, China, autonomous taxis are already operating in real traffic, giving us a glimpse of a future where vehicles navigate on their own.\nThese technologies promise speed, comfort, and convenience — but they also bring important questions. Who will benefit from them? Will they really solve problems like emissions, congestion, and access — or create new inequalities in both the physical and virtual worlds?\nAs we imagine commuting in virtual reality, flying to meetings, or letting AI take the wheel, we should pause and reflect: are we building systems that truly connect people and support communities? Or are we simply chasing innovation without asking who gets left behind?"

Not just how things work, but how they make us feel, who they include, and what values they reflect.\nInnovation should do more than dazzle us — it should serve us. It should respond to real human needs, not just market trends or engineering possibilities. That means asking better questions: Who is this for? Who is left out? Does this make our lives more meaningful, more equitable, more sustainable?\nAs the World Expo 2025 reminds us, the future is not just something we inherit — it’s something we design. Smart solutions can be powerful tools — but only if we use them wisely. The cities and systems of the future don’t have to be cold, digital shells. They can be inclusive, green, and full of life — if we design them that way."

    "text": "📌 Why This Question Matters\nMore and more startups are presenting themselves as climate-neutral or climate-friendly. But why are they doing that? What motivates them? The explanation is quite simple — and closely tied to investment opportunities. Investors are increasingly looking for sustainable ventures, and the climate tech ecosystem — including NGOs, researchers, entrepreneurs, and engaged individuals — plays a crucial role in addressing the climate crisis.\nThe first time I truly experienced the real face of climate change was while working in the humanitarian sector with affected communities. I saw first-hand how essential it is to anticipate and reduce climate risks — whether it’s earthquakes, floods, or heatwaves impacting already vulnerable populations. In these contexts, early action isn’t optional — it’s life-saving.\nThat’s where climate technologies, innovation and startups come in. At the forefront of developing game-changing technologies are tech ventures. They are often seen as engines of innovation, they move fast, experiment boldly, and frequently bring fresh ideas into spaces where traditional actors move slowly. They develop solutions ranging from climate risk prevention and renewable energy systems to energy efficiency innovations, carbon capture methods, and climate-resilient agriculture. Their work provides practical tools for mitigation, prediction, and adaptation.\nIn this blog post, I’ll try to give a brief overview of how we can assess whether young companies are genuinely climate-friendly or simply good at marketing themselves. In the following paragraphs, I’d like to address the following questions:\nAre tech ventures truly driving a green transformation — or are we witnessing a new wave of eco-hype? What does it really mean for a startup to be climate-positive? And how can we tell the difference between genuine innovation and feel-good greenwashing?"

    "section": "📌 What Makes a Startup Truly Climate-Positive?",
    "text": "📌 What Makes a Startup Truly Climate-Positive?\nFirst of all, I’d like to highlight that the terms climate-neutral and climate-positive are often used interchangeably—but they are not the same. Climate-neutral means balancing emissions to reach net zero — typically through a combination of reductions and offsets. Climate-positive, on the other hand, means going further: removing more carbon from the atmosphere than you emit. So:\n\nClimate-neutral ≠ climate-positive.\n\nNowadays, the term climate-positive is gaining a lot of traction, but it is not yet a globally standardized concept, and there is no single official framework that defines it. However, some of the most widely accepted standards in the European climate startup space provide valuable direction on what meaningful and credible climate action looks like.\nAfter reviewing leading sources such as Project Drawdown, the EU Taxonomy, the United Nations Climate Technology Centre & Network (CTCN), and Climate Tech VC (CTVC), I’ve identified a set of key aspects commonly used to assess whether a solution or startup can be considered climate-positive. Below is a brief overview of each:\n\nProject Drawdown ranks science-based climate solutions across sectors. For them, the key focus is on demonstrated greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potential, not just theoretical impact. Solutions should ideally be scalable — regionally or globally — to maximize their effect.\nThe EU Taxonomy defines specific criteria for climate mitigation and adaptation activities and emphasizes the principle of “Do No Significant Harm” to other environmental objectives. It sets technical screening thresholds, helps prevent greenwashing, supports investment alignment, and drives regulatory standardization.\nAccording to the United Nations CTCN, a climate-positive solution should be applied in real-world settings, benefit climate-vulnerable communities, and contribute to long-term resilience and co-benefits — especially in the Global South.\nClimate Tech VC (CTVC) brings the investor and startup perspective. It tracks climate-tech companies across sectors and highlights those delivering scalable, high-impact solutions. CTVC’s market maps are useful for identifying trends, technologies, and startups that contribute meaningfully to climate goals — beyond greenwashing or buzzwords.\n\nTogether, these frameworks highlight the importance of transparency, trustworthy data, and a strong sense of accountability.They also reflect the differing priorities between key players in the climate space. While public sector actors often prioritize social and community-level impact, private sector stakeholders tend to focus on whether a technology is scalable, commercially viable, and market-ready."

    "section": "📌 The Dark Side: Greenwashing Tactics",
    "text": "📌 The Dark Side: Greenwashing Tactics\nCompanies often like to use terms like sustainable, eco-friendly, and climate-positive — but are these claims real and credible, or just marketing buzzwords?\nWith growing pressure to appear green, it can be hard to tell the difference between real climate action and clever storytelling. So what are the red flags we should look out for? How can we recognize when a company or startup is engaging in greenwashing rather than delivering meaningful environmental impact?\nIf we want real climate solutions, we need to look beyond the buzzwords. There are some clear warning signs:\n\nThe company lacks third-party certifications or reliable data to support its claims\nThere’s no reporting on emissions, supply chains, or climate targets\nA general lack of transparency, especially around environmental performance\nFlashy green messaging, while the core business remains highly carbon-intensive\n\nAs green branding becomes more profitable, regulators and watchdogs are paying closer attention. The European Commission, the OECD, and NGOs such as Carbon Market Watch are actively working to detect, monitor, and regulate misleading environmental claims. Their goal is to ensure that sustainability is based on verifiable evidence — not just marketing slogans."

    "section": "📌 The Role of Investors",
    "text": "📌 The Role of Investors\nMore and more startups and scaleups are positioning themselves as green or climate-positive. This opens doors to grants, green funds, and early-stage capital. Investors are often drawn to these buzzwords — and as a result, some startups exaggerate or misrepresent their environmental impact to attract funding. This phenomenon is widely known as greenwashing. Startups may overstate their carbon-saving potential without providing clear data or third-party verification, making it difficult to distinguish authentic impact from marketing-driven narratives.\nInvestors have a huge responsibility in this space. Forward-thinking investors are now shifting toward impact verification, using frameworks like the EU Taxonomy, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and independent ESG ratings to separate genuine climate solutions from eco-hype.\nIn the end, investor responsibility goes beyond capital. It includes asking the right questions, demanding data-backed accountability, and supporting startups that deliver real, measurable environmental benefits."

    "text": "📌 Final Thoughts\nStartups play a crucial role in scaling climate solutions. As agile innovators, they act as catalysts within the broader climate ecosystem — testing, piloting, and scaling technologies that could help drive the transition to a more sustainable future.\nBut while their potential is clear, we must remain thoughtful and critical. Not all that is labeled “green” is truly sustainable. Green marketing can sometimes blur the line between genuine innovation and feel-good branding. That’s why climate tech must be held to high standards — especially as terms like climate-positive gain popularity without a globally agreed-upon definition.\nIn this blog post, I chose not to focus on detailed EU regulatory frameworks like the CSRD, even though they are highly relevant — particularly in connection with the EU Taxonomy. Instead, my aim was to give an accessible overview of the climate innovation landscape and offer a set of criteria for evaluating climate-positive claims with a more informed lens.\nTo help distinguish real impact from empty buzzwords, I’ve summarized key evaluation parameters below — drawn from trusted sources such as Project Drawdown, the EU Taxonomy, CTVC, and the UN Climate Technology Centre.\nBy applying these standards — whether you’re an innovator, investor, policymaker, or curious reader — you can help support climate solutions that are not just exciting, but also effective, credible, and truly sustainable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria\nDescription\nWhy it matters?\n\n\n\n\nTrancparency\nOpenly share clear, accurate, and verifiable data on environmental performance\nBuilds trust and enables oversight\n\n\nAccountability\nTake responsibility for claims; publish goals, track progress, and face consequences\nShows commitment and allows corrective action\n\n\nCertification\nObtain third-party verification or independent audits\nConfirms credibility\n\n\nData Quality\nProvide quantifiable, traceable environmental data (e.g. CO₂e reductions)\nSeparates fact from marketing\n\n\nSystematic Impact\nContributes to long-term, scalable climate solutions rather than minor fixes\nAligns with global standards\n\n\nScientific Basis\nClaims are based on climate science (e.g. life cycle analysis etc.\nIndicates real, lasting change"
